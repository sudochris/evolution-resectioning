## ðŸŽ¥ ðŸ§¬ Evolution Resectioning

This repository contains an implementation for static camera calibration by applying a genetic algorithm.

## Features:

As a core component, a basic algorithm for applying a genetic algorithm is provided. Based on this, the actual camera resectioning algorithm is implemented: Different strategies can be combined into a strategy bundle, which is then used by the algorithm for camera resectioning / calibration. The following strategies are available:

### (A) Initialization / Population

-   BoundedUniformPopulation
-   ValueUniformPopulation

### (B) Fitness strategy

-   DistanceMap
-   DistanceMapWithPunishment

### (C) Selection strategy

-   RouletteWheel
-   Tournament
-   Random

### (D) Crossover strategy

-   SinglePoint
-   TwoPoint
-   Uniform

### (E) Mutation strategy

-   BoundedUniformMutation
-   BoundedDistributionBasedMutation

### (F) Termination strategy

-   MaxIteration
-   NoImprovement
